I think the article explains wireframing very well.
It talks about how communication is important when designing something big.
I agree that designers should talk to engineers and marketing teams to understand the project better.
I also like the idea of sketching first before making a final design. 
It helps to organize thoughts and make sure everything works well. 
Also, the article mentions Omnigraffle, which likes a useful tool for wireframing.
Overall, I found the article helpful and learned more about how to plan designs properly
