        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter (softened)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li> 1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>Fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>Whipped cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Allow it to heat for at least 10 minutes to reach the right temperature</li><br />  
            <li>In a large bowl, mix 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 tsp of baking powder. Add 1/2 cup of softened butter and
                 blend until the mixture is crumbly</li><br />
            <li>Add 2 eggs, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1 cup of milk to the bowl. Stir well until the batter is smooth and lump-free</li><br />  
            <li>Grease a baking pan with butter or non-stick spray. Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula</li><br />    
            <li>Bake the cake for 30-35 minutes. Check if it is ready by inserting a toothpick into the center—if it comes out clean,
                 it is done. Let the cake cool completely on a wire rack (about 20-30 minutes)</li><br />  
            <li>While the cake cools, whip heavy cream (add sugar if desired) until stiff peaks form, or use store-bought whipped cream</li><br />  
            <li>Spread the whipped cream evenly over the top of the cooled cake using a spatula or knife</li><br />    
            <li>Wash and dry fresh strawberries. Slice them or leave them whole and arrange them beautifully on top of the whipped cream</li><br />  
            <li>Slice the cake with a sharp knife and serve. Enjoy your strawberry cream cake!</li><br />
