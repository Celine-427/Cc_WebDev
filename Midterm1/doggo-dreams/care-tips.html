            When a dog first arrives at home, 
            it is recommended to keep them in a 
            crate to make future training easier.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is normal for a dog to bark randomly.
            If that happens, you can place a cloth over the crate.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the puppy has not been dewormed yet, 
            it is best to avoid taking them outside to
             prevent bacterial infections.
            <br>
            <br>
            Puppies are prone to catching a chill.
             It is advised to wait for about a week 
             and ensure they are healthy before bathing them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dogs need monthly internal and external deworming treatments.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before the puppy arrives, make sure to have puppy food ready
             (a dog daily food intake is typically 2.5% to 4% of its body weight).
            <br>
            <br>
            The golden period for dog training is within their first year.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to prepare puppy pads, bowls, a dog bed, and 
            other essentials in advance.
